# Value at Risk Estimation with WGAN-GP

This is repository contains code to estimate Value at risk for a financial portfolio using a generative adverserail network of the WGAN-GP type.
The code is based on some of the code that I used in my master's thesis on the subject [1].

WGAN-GP is used to simulate returns for a financial portfoilio, the 95% VaR can then be estimated as the 5th percentile times -1 (as VaR is in terms of loss).
To get a updated VaR estimate that reflects the current market condition a pretrained model is updated by training the model for a number of additional epochs on recent data.

## Files

**vargan_model.ipynb** - This file creates the WGAN-GP model and gives a pretrained model.  
Here the modification of keras.model and overriding the Model.train_step is based on example code by A_K_Nain [2].  
**backtesting.ipynb** - This file updates the pretrained model to get new estimates for a backtesting period. For each update of the model the model is updated using recent historical data prior to the day the VaR is estimated for.
